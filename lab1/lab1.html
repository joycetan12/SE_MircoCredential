    <h6>By Joyce Tan</h6>

    <p> My name is Joyce Tan. I am a recent graduate at Queens College. I majored in Computer Science and minored in Mathematics. I am taking this Mirco-Credential because I want to learn and improve my technical skills. I would also like to learn more about what to expect in a software engineering job and I am hoping that this course can prepare and lead me to a full time job opportunity.</p>
